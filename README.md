# Cycle

This is a simple replica of the classic game of Tron, specifically the light cycle minigame. The two players use the w,a,s,d and the j,k,l,i keys (the first set
for the first player, and the second set for the second player), to control their bikes, which they will try and get their opponent to collide with. The first player
to get the other to collide with their bike wins! But be careful, if you collide with your own light tail, you will also lose.
